Hey friend :)
Thanks for buying my asset!



The asset is the replacement for the default UI dropdown 
You can fully customize it, change everything from options style to animations
Plus, you can use it in VR with a few changes

My asset works with TMP_InputField and I'm STRONGLY ADVISE you to use TMP text and InputField!!! But obviously you can
easily change it to a default one



How to use it:

There is a scene - here you will see 4 dropdown with 4 different animations
Left two dropdown set the default text from start, right two set the first option as the default text

In a folder Prefabs you can find the dropdown and simply drag it in the canvas
Each dropdown has an object named OptionsObject and here you can customize the options style



Everything about settings and methods you can find in the scrips, every variable and method has a description
The code is fully commented and the dropdown is fully customizable
